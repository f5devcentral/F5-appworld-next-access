                        Command Execution

                        Path Traversal

                        Predictable Resource Location

                        HTTP Protocol Compliance

                        Detection Evasion

                        Insecure Deserialization

                        Information Leakage

                        JSON Parser Attack

        [Filters] Test IDs to exclude (Separated by ',') []: 
                Exclude test IDs to be run.

        [Filters] Test Systems to exclude (Separated by ',') []: 
                Exclude test systems to be run.

        [Filters] Test Attack Types to exclude (Separated by ',') []:
                Exclude attack types to be run.

Here are the possible reasons that could cause the test ID to fail:
        ASM Policy is not in blocking mode

        Attack Signature is not in the ASM Policy

        Attack Signatures are not up to date

        Attack Signature disabled

        Attack Signature is in staging

        Parameter * is in staging

        URL * is in staging

        URL * Does not check signatures

        Header * Does not check signatures

        Evasion disabled

        Evasion technique is not in blocking mode
