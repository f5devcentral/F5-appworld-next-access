**Review of Module 1**

In this module we reviewed how to manually create an Advanced WAF template in the BIG-IP to use for various automation tasks.  The first task was to create the template with a base configuration with a few settings like blocking a geo location, and modifying HTTP protocol compliance settings.
We then used Visual Studio Code to review some pre-configured JSON files that we imported into the BIG-IP to create Advanced WAF policies for us.  This moved us further along the automation path by importing files to the BIG-IP for Advanced WAF policy creation rather than building them manually in the 
BIG-IP.  

Next, we used Postman to interact with the BIG-IP and push our Advanced WAF JSON files calling AS3 on the BIG-IP to fully automate the creation of Advanced WAF policies.  The great news is that there are a **LOT** of AS3 templates already created for you.  To review AS3 and view the other F5 tasks you can do with AS3, visit the F5 AS3 GitHub page:
