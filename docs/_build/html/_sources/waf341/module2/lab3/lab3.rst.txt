By default, the BIG-IP ASM system logs information about incoming requests to
the request log in plain text. In some cases you may want to mask request
information in the logs as some requests include sensitive information, such as
authorization credentials or credit card information. When you enable Mask
Value in Logs for a policy element, the system replaces the sensitive data with
asterisks (\*\*\*\*\*\*). The masked data cannot be viewed by the
administrator.

You can mask data in the logs for the following policy elements.

**Parameters**	Masks the parameter value, including the value for positional
parameters. The setting does not mask the parameter name.

.. code-block:: html

   GET /profiles/******

**HTTP headers**	Masks the header value. The setting does not mask the header
name.

.. code-block:: html

   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: Example.com
   Connection: Keep-alive
   Authorization: ******
   Cookie: TS-Cookie

**Cookies**	Masks the values for allowed and enforced cookies types. The
setting does not mask the cookie name and does not apply to BIG-IP ASM cookies.

.. code-block:: html

   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: Example.com
   Connection: Keep-alive
   Cookie: ******

**JSON Profiles**	Masks elements within the JSON data whose values are should
considered sensitive.

.. code-block:: html

   secID: ******

**XML Profiles**	Masks sensitive data in an XML document. You can specify the
element or attribute whose value contains sensitive data and should be masked
by the policy.

.. code-block:: html

   <secID>******</secID>

Task 1 - Login Page
-------------------

#. Open a new Private Browsing window in **Firefox** .
#. Go to the to Juiceshop login page and login as f5student@agility.com

#. Examine the most recent request in the event logs for /rest/user/login.
   Notice that you **cannot** see the password for f5student@agility.com in the
   request. The password is masked in the logs due to a sensitive parameter
   setting which is created by the policy automatically.

#. Open the BIG-IP GUI interface.

#. Navigate to **Security -> Application Security -> Parameters List** and
   select the Sensitive Parameters tab and view the configuration.

   |lab2.3-9|

#. Next we will obfuscate cookies as they could contain sensitive information
   we would not want an administrator to have access to.

#. Navigate to **Security -> Application Security -> Headers -> Cookies List.**

#. Click Create and create the **io** cookie as seen below

   |lab2.3-2|

#. Click **Create and then Apply Policy**

#. Open a new Private Browsing window in **Firefox** .

#. Go to the to Juiceshop login page and login

#. Examine the most recent requests and compare to earlier requests in the
   event log by navigating to **Security -> Event Logs -> Applications ->
   Requests**.

#. The cookie content is now obfuscated in the Logs when they were visible
   before.
