DataGuard is a DLP-like feature of ASM that can prevent harmful data leakage
from your application in the event of a successful attack. It can also be used
to help prevent users from entering certain types of data that should not be
stored in a particular system.  This feature should be deployed with care as it
has the potential to break applications if applied too broadly.

Task 1 - Configure DataGuard
----------------------------

#. From within your existing ASM policy, navigate to **Security -> Application
   Security -> Data Guard**.

#. Click the **checkbox** to enable DataGuard, then click **Save**.

   |lab2.2-1|

#. Navigate to **Security -> Application Security -> Policy Building ->
   Learning and Blocking Settings**.

#. Use the **search box** to find the ``Data Guard`` section and disable
   blocking:

   |lab2.2-2|

#. Click **Save**.

#. Click **Apply Policy** .

.. note:: Deploying DataGuard too pervasively can have a negative performance
   impact on your system. In a production environment we typically recommend
   deploying DataGard against specific URLs where possible.

Task 2 - Test DataGuard
-----------------------

#. Open a new private browsing window in **Firefox** and login as
   f5student@agility.com to Juiceshop

#. Navigate to **Account > Orders & Payment > My saved addresses**

   |lab2.2-3|

#. Add a new address choosing values for the field and placing something that
   looks like a US Social Security number in the name field.

   |lab2.2-4|

#. Click submit and you will see your save address with the all but the last 4
   digits of the name value replaced with \*\*\*\*

   .. note:: You can also use PCRE to define custom patterns for obfuscation.
      Feel free to experiment with this as it can have interesting consequences
      for the application (intentional or otherwise).

**This concludes section 2.2**
