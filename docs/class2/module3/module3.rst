Lab 3 - Risk-based with HTTP Connector
######################################

Estimate time to complete: 25 minutes.

SAML federation is a key use case where Next Access acts as a service provider (SP) and integrates with an identity provider (IdP) such as Okta. This lab will cover how to create a policy using the Visual Policy Designer (VPD), upload a certificate to the Central Manager (CM), assign flows and rules to the policy, and create an application using a standard template. 

In this lab we will explore how to setup SAML federation with Okta by deploying an Access Policy using Visual Policy Designer

**Learning Objectives:**

- Upload Certificate to Central Manager
- Create Access Policy via Visual Policy Designer (VPD)
- Assign Flows and Rules to the Access policy
- Create Application and attach it to the Access policy
