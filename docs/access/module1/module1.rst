Lab 1 - SAML Federation 
==========================================

Estimate time to complete: 25 minutes.

SAML federation is a key use case where Next Access acts as a service provider (SP) and integrates with an identity provider (IdP) such as Okta. This lab will cover how to create a policy using the Visual Policy Designer (VPD), upload a certificate to the Central Manager (CM), assign flows and rules to the policy, and create an application using a standard template.
